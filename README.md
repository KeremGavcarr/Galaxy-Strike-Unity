# ðŸš€ Galaxy Strike (Unity)

This repository documents my daily progress through the **Galaxy Strike** section of a Unity course.  
The goal is to build a fully functional sci-fi environment with terrains, timelines, and animated enemies.

## ðŸ“… Day 1
- Set up terrain tools and painted textures.  
- Added timeline control for camera and master animation.  
- Experimented with animation curves and enemy timeline movement.

---

## ðŸ§  Next Steps
- Add enemy AI logic and integrate movement triggers.  
- Fine-tune camera animation and polish environment lighting.
