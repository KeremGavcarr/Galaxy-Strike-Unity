# ðŸš€ Galaxy Strike (Unity)

This repository documents my daily progress through the **Galaxy Strike** section of a Unity course.  
The goal is to build a fully functional sci-fi environment with terrains, timelines, and animated enemies.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 1
- Set up terrain tools and painted textures.  
- Added timeline control for camera and master animation.  
- Experimented with animation curves and enemy timeline movement.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 2
- Switched to the new **Input System** and created `PlayerControls.inputactions`.
- Set up a 2D Vector (WASD) composite for movement.
- Started `PlayerMovement.cs` (reading input; movement logic WIP).

## ðŸ§  Next Steps
- Connect input to `Rigidbody` for physics-based movement.
- Add rotation controls and clamp limits.
- Basic camera follow and sensitivity pass.
- Add enemy AI logic and integrate movement triggers.  
- Fine-tune camera animation and polish environment lighting.
